# Strategy game

## Overview
Stable game elements.

### Resources
- population
- materials (could be broken down to more mats)
- art

#### Population
- each belong to a party

#### Materials
- used to feed population
- build buildings

#### Art
- used to upgrade the kingdom
- makes population more sensitive to the choices of the ruler

### Representatives
- represent parties of the kingdom
- give quests to the ruler - upon completing or failing - they give a reaction
- minor reactions to specific actions of the ruler

## Ideas

### Real-time vs Turn-based
Real-time pros:
- no waiting between rounds
- more intense - timer is always running

Turn-based pros:
- easier multiplayer implementation
- resource calculation can be more complex
- round timer + action limit to limit the player

### Tech-tree
Reaching certain levels of art, the ruler is presented with deterministic choices as a skill-tree. They are upgrades to production or additional laws to guide the kingdom in the rulers way.
- Corruption - putting a point in corruption will replace one of the representatives with someone who always agrees with the ruler. This means that part of the population will do whatever the ruler says unless they push their luck. (so their acceptance keeps on changing, but it will only be a problem once it reaches an extremely low value)

## Game Idea

To play a ruler and build your small empire behind your table alongside the realms most influential faces watching your every move, interfering with your actions for their own benefits.

This game would either be a real-time or turn based strategy, with a political focus. The challenge is balancing war with peace as the latter helps the kingdom prosper, while the kingdom is facing dangers enclosing slowly on its walls.

    Play as a ruler
    Order units around the map in front of you using your hands, make them:
        Gather resources
        Send out scouts, messengers
        Fight armies as they travel
        Siege towns 

    The map of the realm features difficult terrain, water and weather 

    Peace generates art, the amount of which are measured in paintings situated behind the player. They should resemble the kingdoms overall mindset. (Hitting certain paintings or combos of paintings should reward the player with an achievement)
    Fighting battles also adds to the collection, but they are placed elsewhere. The player should be able to browse through them.
        Scrape Wikipedia for historical battle paintings and the battle statistics, and whenever a fight is won get a painting closest resembling the painting battle statistics. (Potentially giving an achievement for famous battles) 

    Have influential people from the realms (but mostly from your kingdom) watch over your shoulder working in their own favor, trying to manipulate you. The composition of influencers is dictated by the current art direction.
        They give the player quests - failing many of these will leave the kingdom voting for a new ruler, banishing the player
        Whisper, complain and gratify the player
